#' A sample dataset processed following instructions from \url{https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/RNAseq-R/align-and-count.nb.html};
#' In the provided instructions truncated data was used; however this dataset uses the full data of the last sequencing run, although the index was constructed using only chr1.
