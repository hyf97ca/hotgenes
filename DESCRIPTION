Description: This package generates a visualization similar to that provided by the NCBI Sequence Viewer heatmap.
    It improves on the NCBI Sequence Viewer by having a configurable physics tick simulator to model the RNA-seq expression values as if they were actually heat, warming up adjacent exons.
